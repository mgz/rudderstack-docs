# Software Releases

 At RudderStack, we strive to make our deployment simple. To get started, please go through our guide on [installing and setting up RudderStack](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack) on the platform of your choice. 

{% hint style="success" %}
If you're using RudderStack in production, we highly recommend using our Docker images. Our Docker images are always up-to-date, and well-tested in a production environment.
{% endhint %}

## Docker Images

We release Docker images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) every 2 weeks with the latest features and fixes.
