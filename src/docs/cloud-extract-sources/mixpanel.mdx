# Mixpanel

[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) is an analytics platform that helps you to track user actions with your application. It also provides specific tools for targeted business communication and engagement with your customers. In-app A/B testing, user survey forms, and custom reports to measure customer retention are some of the other features offered by Mixpanel.

This document guides you in setting up Mixpanel as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Mixpanel data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

  - **API Key** : Enter your Mixpanel API Key, which can be obtained from the **Project Settings** option in your Mixpanel header bar.
  - **API Secret** : Enter your Mixpanel API Secret, which can be obtained from the Project Settings option as mentioned above.
  - **Project timezone** : This can be obtained within the **Access URL** section in your Mixpanel **Project Settings** option.

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

That's it! Mixpanel is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from your Mixpanel source as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already configured a data
warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse
destination from scratch, click on the **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
