# Xero

[Xero](https://www.xero.com/us/) is a popular cloud-based accounting software, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, accountants, and book-keepers. It allows you to simplify your accounting and everyday business-related tasks, including bill payments, bank connections, and claiming expenses.

This document guides you in setting up Xero as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Xero data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

<strong>All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.</strong>

  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the{" "}
  <strong>Add Destination</strong> button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
