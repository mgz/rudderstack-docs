# Zendesk

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a popular customer support, sales and service platform that lets you serve and engage with your customers effectively. Zendesk offers integrated customer support, a modern sales CRM, as well as a smart, self-serve knowledge base. In addition, its analytics and reporting capabilities lets you understand your customers better. In addition, you can also engage with them more effectively through Zendesk's personalized live chats and messaging service.

This document guides you in setting up Zendesk as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Zendesk data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
