# HubSpot

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) is a leading marketing and sales platform that helps you track leads, as well as inbound marketing and sales. It offers state-of-the-art tools for efficient marketing, tracking sales, and offering better customer support.

This document guides you in setting up HubSpot as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified HubSpot data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

**All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.**

{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

To set up HubSpot as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:

- Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).

### Specifying Connection Credentials

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've already configured HubSpot as a source before, you can choose the account visible under the **Use existing credentials** tab.

{% endhint %}

### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table in your warehouse with this prefix name and load all your HubSpot data into it.
- Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your HubSpot account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

### Selecting the Data to Import

- Finally, choose the HubSpot data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all the data, or choose specific HubSpot data attributes, as per your requirement.

That's it! HubSpot is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from HubSpot as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

{% hint style="success" %}
Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already configured a data
warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse
destination from scratch, click on the **Add Destination** button.
{% endhint %}

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
