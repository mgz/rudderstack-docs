# Stripe

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is an online payment processing system for businesses. It offers cutting-edge software and APIs that allows thousands of businesses to manage their business payments online. Retailers, subscription businesses, software platforms, and online marketplaces all use Stripe for online payment.

This document guides you in setting up Stripe as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Stripe data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
