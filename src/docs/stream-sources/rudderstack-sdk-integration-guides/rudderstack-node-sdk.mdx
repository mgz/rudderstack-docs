  server-side events to various destinations.

# Node.js

RudderStack’s Node.js SDK lets you track your customer event data from your Node.js app and route them to your specified destination platforms.

<div class="successBlock">
  Find the code for this SDK in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-node">GitHub
  repository</a>.
</div>

## Installing the RudderStack Node.js SDK

To install the RudderStack Node.js SDK using [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/), run the following command:

```bash
npm install @rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node
```

## Using the RudderStack Node.js SDK

To use the SDK, run the following code snippet:

```javascript
const Analytics = require("@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node")

// RudderStack requires the batch endpoint of the server you are running
const client = new Analytics(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL / v1 / batch)
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user to their actions as well as captures the relevant traits or properties related to that user.

<div class="infoBlock">
For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, refer to our <a href="../../rudderstack-api/rudderstack-spec/identify">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

An example `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
client.identify({
  userId: "123456",
  traits: {
    name: "Name Username",
    email: "name@website.com",
    plan: "Free",
    friends: 21,
  },
})
```

The `identify` parameters are as described below:

## Node.js SDK Data Persistence

<div class="infoBlock">
This feature is still in beta. Contact us on our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community">Slack</a> channel in case you face any issues.

</div>

The Node.js SDK retries event delivery `n` times, if it fails to successfully deliver the event data to RudderStack. Since the data is in-memory, `n` should ideally be a small number, failing which there is a possibility of data loss if RudderStack is not available for a larger duration.

To prevent data loss from the SDK to RudderStack while it is not ready to accept data or temporarily unreachable, we have introduced a feature to persist the event data in **Redis**, leading to better event delivery guarantees. Also, the SDK can retry multiple times as the queue is maintained in a different process space \(in this case, Redis\).

You will need to host a Redis server and use it as the intermediary data storage queue to use this feature.

<div class="infoBlock">
We use <a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull">Bull</a> as the interface layer between the Node.js SDK and Redis.

</div>

The initialization of the SDK is as follows:

```jsx
const client = new Analytics("write_key","server_url/v1/batch",{
    flushAt: <number> = 20,
    flushInterval: <ms> = 20000
    // the max number of elements that the SDK can hold in memory,
    // this is different than the Redis list created when persistence is enabled.
    // This restricts the data in-memory when Redis is down, unreachable etc.
    maxInternalQueueSize: <number> = 20000
});

client.createPersistenceQueue({ redisOpts: { host: "localhost" } }, err => {})
```

To achieve the data persistence, you need to call the `createPersistenceQueue` method which takes two parameters as input - `queueOpts` and a `callback`. This will initialize the persistent queue.

The specifications of these parameters are as follows:

### `queueOpts`

```jsx
QueueOpts {
    queueName ?: string = rudderEventsQueue,
    isMultiProcessor ? : boolean = false
    // pass a value without the {}, this will used as prefix to Redis keys,
    // needed to support Redis cluster slots.
    prefix ? : string = {rudder},
    redisOpts : RedisOpts,
    jobOpts ?: JobOpts
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">
More information on this parameter can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/develop/REFERENCE.md#queue">Bull docs</a>.

</div>

```jsx
RedisOpts {
    port?: number = 6379;
    host?: string = localhost;
    db?: number = 0;
    password?: string;
}
```

```jsx
JobOpts {
    maxAttempts ? : number = 10
}
```

### `callback`

```jsx
// createPersistenceQueue calls this with error or nothing(in case of success), // user should retry in case of error
callback: function(error) || function()
```

Calling the `createPersistenceQueue` method will initialize a Redis list by calling [**Bull's**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) utility methods. It will also add a **single** job processor for the processing \(making requests to RudderStack\) jobs that are pushed into the list. Any error encountered while doing this leads to calling `callback` with the error.

<div class="infoBlock">
It is recommended to retry calling <code class="inline-code">createPersistenceQueue</code> with a backoff, if the callback returns with an error.

</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
If the <code class="inline-code">createPersistenceQueue</code> method is not called after initializing the SDK, the SDK will work without any persistence.

</div>

### **Configurable Parameters**

- **`flush()`**: You can use this method to ensure that all the events in the queue are processed. The following snippet highlights the user of `flush()` with a callback:

```jsx
client.flush(function (err, batch) {
  console.log("Flushing done")
})
```

- **`flushAt`** : The maximum number of events to batch and send to the server. The default value is **20**.
- **`flushInterval`** : The maximum timespan after which the events from the in-memory queue is flushed to Redis' persistence queue. The default value is **20 seconds**.
- **`maxInternalQueueSize`** - The maximum size of the in-memory queue. The default value is **20000**.
- **`JobOpts.maxAttempts`** - The maximum number of retry attempts. The default value is **10**.
- **`isMultiProcessor`** - Determines whether to handle previously active jobs. If set to `false`, the previously active job will be picked up first by the processor. Otherwise, Bull moves this job to the back of the Redis queue to be picked up after the already pushed event.

<div class="warningBlock">
If the same queue (RudderStack SDK initialized with the same queue name) is used in multiple servers, set this value to <code class="inline-code">true</code> as event ordering is not present in this case.

</div>

### **Flow**

- Calling the SDK methods like `track`, `page`, `identify`, etc. pushes the events to an in-memory array.
- The events from the array are flushed as a `batch` to the Redis persistence based on the `flushAt` and `flushInterval` settings. The in-memory array has a maximum size of `maxInternalQueueSize`. **Once this size limit is reached,** __**the events won't be accepted if not drained to the other side \(cases where Redis connection is slow or the Redis server is not reachable\).**
- The processor will take the batch from the Redis list and make a request to RudderStack. In case of an error, the processor will retry sending the data again if the error can be retried \(errors with status code `5xx and 429`\). **The retry will go up to `JobOpts.maxAttempts` with an** **exponential backoff of power 2 with max backoff of 30 seconds**.
- If the job fails even after `JobOpts.maxAttempts`, it will not be retried again and pushed to a `failed queue`. **You can retry them later manually using Bull’s utility methods** [**listed here**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/develop/REFERENCE.md#queuegetfailed) **or get them from Redis directly**.
- There might be a scenario where the node process dies with the jobs still in active state \(not completed nor failed but in the process of sending/retrying\). Since the RudderStack SDK has only **1 processor for sending events** \(this count should always be **1**\), the next time the SDK is initialized and `createPersistenceQueue` is called, **the jobs will be picked up first by the processor to get processed to maintain event ordering based on the value of `QueueOpts.isMultiProcessor`**.
- For multiple servers \(SDK\) connecting to the same queue \(`QueueOpts.queueName`\), there will be multiple processors fetching events from the same queue and event ordering won’t be implemented. Hence, `QueueOpts.isMultiProcessor` should be set to **`true`.**
