  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s Go SDK to send events
  to various destinations
---

# Go

RudderStack’s Go SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Go code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go).

## Installing the RudderStack Go SDK

The RudderStack Go SDK package can be simply installed via the `go get` command. It is recommended that you use a tool like Godep to avoid issues related to the breaking API changes introduced between major versions of the library.

To install it in the `GOPATH`, run the following:

```go
go get github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go
```

## Using the RudderStack Go SDK

To use the SDK, run the following code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go"
)

func main() {
    // Instantiates a client to use send messages to the Rudder API.
    client := analytics.New(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL)

    // Enqueues a track event that will be sent asynchronously.
    client.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
        UserId: "test-user",
        Event:  "test-snippet",
    })

    // Flushes any queued messages and closes the client.
    client.Close()
}
```

Alternatively,

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go"
)

func main() {
    // Instantiates a client to use send messages to the Rudder API.
    client, _ := analytics.NewWithConfig(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL,
        analytics.Config{
            Interval:  30 * time.Second,
            BatchSize: 100,
            Verbose:   true,
        })

    // Enqueues a track event that will be sent asynchronously.
    client.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
        UserId: "test-user",
        Event:  "test-snippet",
    })

    // Flushes any queued messages and closes the client.
    client.Close()
}
```

The `Config` object parameters are as described below:

| **Field**               | **Type**      | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :------------ | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Interval`              | time.Duration | Optional     | Messages will be sent when this flushing interval time triggers                          |
| `BatchSize`             | int           | Optional     | Total number of messages to be sent in a single batch                                    |
| `Verbose`               | bool          | Optional     | When set to true, the client will send more frequent and detailed messages to its logger |
| `RetryAfter`            | time.Duration | Optional     | This can be used to set up how long the failed messages can be retried                   |
| `maxConcurrentRequests` | int           | Optional     | The maximum number of parallel goroutines which will be spawned                          |
| `NoProxySupport`        | bool          | Optional     | Setting this variable to true will disable making calls to cluster-info end point        |

For Users who do not use a proxy can make the NoProxySupport to true while initialising Config , this will avoid making calls to the proxy for fetching the total number of nodes in case of multi-node setup

```go
    // Instantiates a client to use send messages to the Rudder API.
    client, _ := analytics.NewWithConfig(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL,
        analytics.Config{
            Interval:  30 * time.Second,
            BatchSize: 100,
            NoProxySupport:   true,
        })
```
