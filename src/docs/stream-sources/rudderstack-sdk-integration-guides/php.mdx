  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s PHP SDK to send events
  to various destinations
---

# PHP

RudderStack’s PHP SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your PHP code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-php-sdk).

## Installing the RudderStack PHP SDK

Install the RudderStack PHP SDK using the [composer](https://packagist.org/packages/rudderstack/rudder-php-sdk). You can also do so by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-php-sdk /my/app/folders/
```

You can use composer to install the SDK. Use the following command.

```bash
composer require rudderstack/rudder-php-sdk
```

## Initializing the RudderStack Client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```php
require_once("/path/to/lib/Rudder.php");

Rudder::init(WRITE_KEY, array(
  "data_plane_url" => DATA_PLANE_URL,
  "consumer"       => "lib_curl", // fork_curl
  "debug"          => true,
  "max_queue_size" => 10000,
  "batch_size"     => 100
));
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
We append the protocol to `DATA_PLANE_URL` before sending the events to RudderStack server.

For example if your dataPlaneUrl is `https://example.dataplane.com` mention only `example.dataplane.com`

{% endhint %}

## Sending Events from RudderStack

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send relevant customer events from the RudderStack client. An example `track` call is as shown in the following code snippet:

```php
Rudder::track(array(
  "userId" => "f4ca124298",
  "event" => "Signed Up",
  "properties" => array(
    "plan" => "Enterprise"
  )
));
```
