  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s Ruby SDK to send
  events to various destinations
---

# Ruby

RudderStack’s Ruby SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Ruby code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-ruby-sync).

## Installing the RudderStack Ruby SDK

To install the RudderStack Ruby SDK, add this line to your application's Gem file:

```ruby
gem 'rudder_analytics_sync'
```

You can also install it yourself, as below:

```bash
gem install rudder_analytics_sync
```

## Using the RudderStack Ruby SDK

To use the SDK, create a client instance as shown:

```ruby
Analytics = RudderAnalyticsSync::Client.new(
  write_key: WRITE_KEY, # required
  data_plane_url: DATA_PLANE_URL
  on_error: proc { |error_code, error_body, exception, response|
    # defaults to an empty proc
  }
)
```

You can use it as shown in the following snippet:

```ruby
Analytics.track(
  user_id: user.id,
  event: 'Created Account'
)
```

### Manually batching the events

You can manually batch events with `analytics.batch` as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.batch do |batch|
  batch.context = {...}       # shared context for all events
  batch.integrations = {...}  # shared integrations hash for all events
  batch.identify(...)
  batch.track(...)
  batch.track(...)
  ...
end
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user to their actions as well as captures the relevant traits or properties related to that user.

<div class="infoBlock">

For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, please refer to our RudderStack API specification guide.

</div>

An example `identify` call is as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.identify(
    user_id: '12345',
    traits: { email: "#{ username.email }", friends: 1 },
    context: {ip: '10.81.20.10'}
