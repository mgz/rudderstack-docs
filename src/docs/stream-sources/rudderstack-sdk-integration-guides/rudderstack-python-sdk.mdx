  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s Python SDK to send
  events to various destinations
---

# Python

RudderStack’s Python SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Python code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-python).

## Installing the RudderStack Python SDK

To install the RudderStack Python SDK using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), run the following command:

```bash
pip install rudder-sdk-python
```

## Initializing the RudderStack Client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```python
import rudder_analytics

rudder_analytics.write_key = WRITE_KEY
rudder_analytics.data_plane_url = DATA_PLANE_URL
```

## Sending Events from RudderStack

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send relevant customer events from the RudderStack client. An example `track` call is as shown in the following code snippet:

```python
rudder_analytics.track('developer_user_id', 'Simple Track Event', {
  'key1': 'val1'
})
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user to their actions as well as captures the relevant traits or properties related to that user.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a detailed explanation of the `identify` call, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-api-spec) guide.

## Alias

The `alias` call allows you to associate one identity with another.

{% hint style="info" %}
`alias` is an advanced method. However, it is required when managing user identities in some destinations.

{% endhint %}

An example `alias` call is as shown:

```python
rudder_analytics.alias('previousid', 'userid')
```

The `alias` method parameters are as mentioned below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                       |

{% hint style="info" %}
For a detailed explanation of the `alias` call, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-api-spec) guide.

{% endhint %}

## Error Handling

To handle errors that may occur when sending these events via `rudder_analytics` you can declare a callback called `on_error`.

```text
def on_error(error, events):
    print("Error response:", error)

rudder_analytics.on_error = on_error
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** this will only return errors that may occur with the HTTP request to the Gateway. Any errors that occur downstream will not be returned via this callback.

{% endhint %}

Common request responses from the Gateway are as follows

| Status                                     | Code |
| :----------------------------------------- | :--- |
| Ok                                         | 200  |
| Request neither has anonymousId nor userId | 400  |
| Invalid Write Key                          | 401  |
| Invalid JSON                               | 400  |
