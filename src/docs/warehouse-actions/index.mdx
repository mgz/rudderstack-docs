# Warehouse Actions Sources

## What are Sources in RudderStack?

Sources are the tools or platforms from which you can send event data to RudderStack. These events can then be routed \(with or without transformation\) into your data warehouse or third-party destinations for analytics and other activation use-cases.

## RudderStack Warehouse Actions

With RudderStack **Warehouse Actions**, you can leverage the already processed customer data residing in your data warehouse and route this enriched information to your desired destinations.

<div class="successBlock">

**With this feature, you can configure your data warehouse as a source on the <a href="https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial">RudderStack dashboard</a>, select the right data and then sync this data to all the supported destinations.**
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

You can connect only one destination to a Warehouse Actions source. If you want to send data to multiple destinations, we recommend creating a source with the same settings for each destination.

<div class="warningBlock">

You cannot connect a Warehouse Actions source to a warehouse destination in RudderStack.

Here's a detailed walkthrough of the Warehouse Actions feature:

## Configuring Warehouse Actions on RudderStack

To configure your data warehouse as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:

- Log into your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).
- Navigate to **Sources**, present in the left panel of the dashboard.
- Choose your preferred data warehouse which you want to configure as a source, as shown. Then, click on **Next**.

### Specifying Connection Credentials

- Assign a name to your source. Then, click on the **Create credentials from scratch** button, if you are configuring your data warehouse in the RudderStack dashboard for the first time.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have previously configured your data warehouse as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, you can simply use the existing credentials and proceed.

</div>

- Next, enter the connection credentials to configure your data warehouse connection with RudderStack, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-08-at-9.37.06-pm.png" />

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack currently supports **Google BigQuery**, **PostgreSQL**, **ClickHouse**, **Amazon Redshift**, and **Snowflake** as sources. The connection settings will vary according to each warehouse.

</div>

### Specifying Warehouse Schema and Table

- Next, enter the data warehouse schema and the table name. RudderStack will collect the data from this table.

<img src="../../../images/assets/4 (7).png" />

<div class="warningBlock">

Please note that your source table must include at least one of the following columns for it to be considered a valid source:
  
<ul><li><strong>email</strong></li>
<li><strong>user_id</strong></li>
<li><strong>anonymous_id</strong></li></ul>
</div>

- If the table is valid, you can then preview a snippet of the data, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/5.png" />

- You can also filter, select and edit the column names of the table to be included as the data source, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/6 (6).png" />

<img src="../../../images/assets/7 (2) (1).png" />

- Once you've selected all the the required table columns, click on **Next**.

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- RudderStack also allows you to specify the data update frequency and set a data synchronization time as per your requirement.

<img src="../../../images/assets/8.png" />

That's it! Your data warehouse is now configured and added as a RudderStack source.

<img src="../../../images/assets/9.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Currently all events sent to RudderStack via warehouse as a source will be <code class="inline-code">identify()</code> events

</div>

Now you can connect this source to any RudderStack destination of your choice. RudderStack will collect the enriched customer data from the specified table columns in your warehouse source and send it to the destination for your activation use-cases.

## Warehouse Actions Constants

Constants give you the ability to add new fields to each event with a pre-defined value. The **key** of a Warehouse Actions constant has the same functionality as modifying an existing column, and is in the format \(**test.value, test.value\[0\]**\).

### How to add a Warehouse Actions constant

Adding a new constant when configuring a Warehouse Actions source is very easy:

- Click on the **Add Constant** button as shown below, while [mapping your table](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions#specifying-warehouse-schema-and-table):

<img src="../../../images/assets/image (77).png" />

- Add your preferred key and value for the constant, select **Ok** and then click on **Confirm**, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/image (76).png" />

- The new constant appears in the table and also in the JSON preview inside the traits, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/screenshot_2021-03-18_at_3.51.11_pm.png" />

- You can also use dot notation to define a Warehouse Actions constant, as shown below:

<img src="../../../images/assets/screenshot_2021-03-18_at_3.52.00_pm.png" />

- The result would look something like:

<img src="../../../images/assets/screenshot_2021-03-18_at_3.52.26_pm.png" />

## FAQs

### Can I connect a Warehouse Actions source to multiple destinations?

We recommend creating a separate Warehouse Actions source with the same settings for each destination where you want to send the data.

### What type of events are supported by the RudderStack Warehouse Actions?

Currently all events from the RudderStack warehouse actions are `identify()` events.
