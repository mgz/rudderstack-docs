# Google BigQuery

[**Google BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is an industry-leading, fully-managed cloud data warehouse that allows you to store and analyze petabytes of data in no time.

This guide will help you configure BigQuery as a source from which you can route event data to your desired destinations through RudderStack.

## Granting Permissions

Follow these steps below to grant the necessary permissions for Warehouse Actions. For BigQuery, use the **BigQuery Console**.

### Creating the role and adding required permissions

* Go to [**https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles**](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles) and click on **CREATE ROLE**.
* Then, fill in the details as shown:

<img src="../assets/image1.png" />

* Next, click on **ADD PERMISSIONS** and add the permissions as listed in the following image:

<img src="../assets/image3.png" />

The permissions are as shown below:

```
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.jobs.list
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.list
bigquery.tables.update
bigquery.tables.updateData
```

* After adding all the required permissions, click on **CREATE**.

### Creating the service account & attaching the role to it

* Next, go to [**https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts**](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
* Select the project which has the dataset or the table that you want to use.
* Click on **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
* Fill in the details in Step **1** as shown below, and click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**:

<img src="../assets/image2.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Note down the **Service account ID**. This ID is required while creating the RudderStack schema and granting the required permissions to it.
</div>

* Then, fill in the details in Step **2** as shown below, and click **CONTINUE**:

<img src="../assets/image4.png" />

* After completing steps **1** and **2**, click on **DONE**. This will move you to the list of service accounts.

### Creating and downloading the JSON key

* Now, click on the three dots under **Actions** in the service account that you just created and select **Manage keys**, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/133751172-bd11d971-1e15-4c06-831e-23058a2eed86.png" />

* Click on **ADD KEY**, followed by **Create new key**, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/133751255-356dab76-a795-4428-8e72-9c46b0031d79.png" />

* In the resulting pop-up, select **JSON** and click on **CREATE**.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/133751286-a7897da9-eb9d-48ef-be29-f16f0e65e2bb.png" />

* Finally, download this JSON file. This file is required while creating a BigQuery warehouse source in RudderStack - the next section covers the steps to do this.

### Creating the RudderStack schema and granting permissions

* The following command creates a dedicated schema `rudderstack_` used by RudderStack for storing the state of each data sync.

```
create schema rudderstack_;
```

* The following query allows the service account `Rudderstack` to have full access to the schema `rudderstack_` \(used by RudderStack\).

```
GRANT `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`
     ON SCHEMA rudderstack_
     TO "serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>";
```

## Setting up the Source

To set up Google BigQuery as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

* Log into your <a href="https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial">RudderStack dashboard</a>.
* From the left panel, select **Sources**. Then, click on **Add Source**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/image%20%2897%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%283%29%20%287%29.png" />

* Scroll down to the **Warehouse Sources** and select **BigQuery**. Then, click on **Next**.

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-2.03.31-pm.png" />

### Setting Up the Connection

* Assign a name to your source, and click on **Create Credentials from Scratch**. Then, click on **Next**.

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-2.05.48-pm.png" />

<div class="successBlock">

If you've already configured BigQuery as a source before, the existing credentials will automatically appear in the above window.
</div>

* Next, enter the **GCP project ID** and the **Credentials** JSON which RudderStack will use to import the data from your BigQuery instance.

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-2.07.29-pm.png" />

### Specifying the Data to Import

* Next, select the **Schema** and the **Table** from which you want RudderStack to import the data.

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-5.18.59-pm.png" />

<div class="warningBlock">

Your table must include one of the following columns - `email`, `user_id`, or `anonymous_id`.
</div>

* Once you specify the table containing the required columns, you will be able to preview a snippet of your data, as shown below:

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-3.21.38-pm.png" />

* Here, you can select all or only a few specific columns of your choice, search the columns by a keyword, and also edit the **JSON Trait Key**, as shown below. You can also preview the resultant JSON on the right. Once you've select the required table columns to import the data from, click on **Next**.

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-3.22.09-pm.png" />

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

* Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your PostgreSQL database to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option. Then, click on **Next**.

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-05-at-5.19.23-pm.png" />

That's it! BigQuery is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from your BigQuery instance as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your preferred destinations by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-2.55.24-pm%20%281%29.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have already configured a destination on the RudderStack platform, choose the **Connect Destinations** option. To add a new destination from scratch, you can select the **Add Destination** option.
</div>

## FAQ

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Warehouse Actions source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<img src="../assets/validations.png" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the `rudderstack_` schema that you have created by successfully running all the commands in the [**User Permissions**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery#granting-permissions) section. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the `rudderstack_` schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it. For more information, refer to [**this section**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions).
