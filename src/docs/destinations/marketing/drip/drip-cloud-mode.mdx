# Cloud Mode

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on sending events via the Cloud mode, refer to the [**RudderStack Connection Modes**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes) guide.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our**
[**GitHub
repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/drip)**.**
{% endhint %}

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you add a new user or update an existing user with the latest information like the user's `dripId`,`email`,`name`, etc.

If you provide the **Campaign ID** in the dashboard while setting up the destination, RudderStack will subscribe every user to this `campaign ID` by default. Alternatively, you can also send the information via the `identify` call using `externalId` as shown in the code snippet below. Note that this takes a higher precedence than the campaign ID provided in the RudderStack dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
Either the `dripId` or `email` is required for the `identify` call. If you are creating a user, then you must provide the `email`. In case of updating a user, you can provide either the assigned `dripId` or `email`.

{% endhint %}

A sample `identify` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "user123",
  {
    email: "sampleuser@testmail.com",
    firstName: "Demo",
    lastName: "Example",
    tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
    customFields: {
      filter1: "filterval1",
    },
  },
  {
    externalId: [
      {
        type: "dripCampaignId",
        id: "<your campaign id>",
      },
      {
        type: "dripId",
        id: "<user's drip id>",
      },
    ],
  }
)
```

### Identify Mapping

The following table includes all the fields in `identify` call with their relative mapping to the Drip fields:

| **RudderStack Field**                | **Drip Field**       |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| `newEmail`                           | `new_email`          |
| `phone`                              | `phone`              |
| `firstName`/`first_name`/`firstname` | `first_name`         |
| `lastName`/`last_name`/`lastname`    | `last_name`          |
| `tags`                               | `tags`               |
| `removeTags`                         | `remove_tags`        |
| `status`                             | `status`             |
| `initialStatus`                      | `initial_status`     |
| `timeZone`                           | `time_zone`          |
| `country`                            | `country`            |
| `city`                               | `city`               |
| `zip`                                | `zip`                |
| `euConsent`                          | `eu_consent`         |
| `euConsentMessage`                   | `eu_consent_message` |
| `ip`                                 | `ip_address`         |
| `address`                            | `address1`           |
| `address2`                           | `address2`           |
| `lifetimeValue`                      | `lifetime_value`     |
| `prospect`                           | `prospect`           |
| `baseLeadScore`                      | `base_lead_score`    |
| `customFields`                       | `custom_fields`      |

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that:

- If `customFields` is not present, RudderStack extracts all the fields apart from the ones mentioned in the table above and constructs a `customFields` object.
- If `customFields` is present **and** there are other fields apart from the ones mentioned in the table, RudderStack ignores them.
- The `address` field should be an object.
  {% endhint %}

When you provide the **Campaign ID**, you can also send some extra fields with the call.

The following table lists all the supported fields for the `campaign` call:

| **RudderStack Field** | **Drip Field**          |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `doubleOptin`         | `double_optin`          |
| `startingEmailIndex`  | `starting_email_index`  |
| `reactivateIfRemoved` | `reactivate_if_removed` |

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on using these fields, refer to the [**Drip documentation**](https://developer.drip.com/#subscribe-someone-to-an-email-series-campaign).

{% endhint %}

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user events and the information associated with them, like `action`, `occurred_at`, and `customFields`. Either `id` or `email` must be provided in this call.

The **User Creation Mode** option in the RudderStack dashboard lets you create a user with their `email` if they don't already exist. If you don't want new users to be created, disable this option.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the `dripId` is provided in the call, then new users will not be created even if the **User Creation Mode** option is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard.

{% endhint %}

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Event Name",
  {
    email: "sampleuser@testmail.com",
    affiliation: "custom_store",
    order_id: "123456",
    products: [
      {
        name: "product_name",
        price: 10.0,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    externalId: [
      {
        type: "dripId",
        id: "<user's drip id>",
      },
    ],
  }
)
```

### Special Events

You can create or update a user order if the event name belongs to either of the following special events:

- `order updated`
- `order completed`
- `order refunded`
- `order cancelled`
- `checkout started`
- `fulfilled` / `order fulfilled`

### Track Fields

A `track` call can contain the following fields:

| **RudderStack Field** | **Drip Field** |
| :-------------------- | :------------- |
| `prospect`            | `prospect`     |
| `customFields`        | `properties`   |
| `occurred_at`         | `occurred_at`  |

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that:

- If `customFields` is not present, RudderStack extracts all the fields apart from the ones mentioned in the table above and constructs a `customFields` object.
- If `customFields` is present **and** there are other fields apart from the ones mentioned in the table, RudderStack ignores them.
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The `products` field is not mandatory. However, if provided, each object must contain the `name` and `price` field, otherwise it will be dropped.

**Note that the `track` call will still not be aborted in such a scenario.**
