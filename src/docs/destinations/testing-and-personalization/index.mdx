# A/B Testing & Personalization

A/B Testing and personalization platforms allow you to experiment with new features and measure their impact on your product. You can use these insights to personalize customer experiences and, in turn, boost your overall revenue and customer retention.

RudderStack supports sending your event data to these platforms for various experimentation and personalization use-cases.
