# Facebook App Events

[**Facebook App Events**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/) \*\*\*\*is Facebook's event tracking functionality. It lets you track events via your app or web page, including user activities such as app installation, purchases, etc. This information is sent to Facebook for analytics and ad targeting, optimization, and measurement.

RudderStack supports Facebook App Events as a destination to which you can send your event data seamlessly.

<div class="successBlock">
  **Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our**
  [**GitHub
  repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/fb)**.**
</div>

## Getting Started

To enable sending data to Facebook App Events, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to App Events.

Before configuring App Events as a destination, verify if Facebook supports the source platform by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | -             | **Supported** | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/rudderstack-connection-modes) guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Facebook App Events, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Facebook App Events**.

<div class="infoBlock">
Please follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/how-to-guides/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack) for more information.

</div>

- Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

![Connection Settings for Facebook App Events](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28118%29.png)

- Enter the **Facebook App ID**.

The following options are applicable if you are using the Device mode to send your events to Facebook:

- **Limited Data Use**: If this option is enabled, you can send the country and state of the end-user so that Facebook processes the user data according to the data regulations set for that region.

<div class="successBlock">
  For more information on this option, refer to the [**Limited Data
  Use**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/advertising/facebook-app-events#limited-data-use)
  section below.
</div>

- Click on **Next** to complete the configuration.

That's it! Facebook App Events should now be added and enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Adding Facebook App Events to Your Project

Depending on your platform of integration, follow these steps below to add App Events to your project:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}
To add Facebook to your iOS project:

- Add the following line to your [**CocoaPods**](https://cocoapods.org/) `Podfile` :

```groovy
pod 'Rudder-Facebook'
```

- Initialize the Facebook App Events iOS SDK just before intializing the RudderStack iOS SDK as shown:

```objectivec
[[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application
                             didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
```

- Send the user's consent to App Events as shown below:

  - For **Objective-C**:

  ```objectivec
  // Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to YES if a user provides consent
  [FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled:YES];
  // Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to NO if a user does not provide consent
  [FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled:NO];
  ```

  - For **Swift**:

  ```swift
  // Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to true if a user provides consent
  Settings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled(true)
  // Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to false if a user does not provide consent
  Settings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled(false)
  ```

- Configure your project by adding the following lines to `(<dict>...</dict>)` in your `Info.plist` :

```markup
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
  <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
  <array>
    <string>fbAPP-ID</string>
  </array>
  </dict>
</array>
<key>FacebookAppID</key>
<string>APP-ID</string>
<key>FacebookClientToken</key>
<string>CLIENT-TOKEN</string>
<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
<string>APP-NAME</string>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Make sure you replace `fbAPP-ID` , `APP-ID`, `CLIENT-TOKEN`, `APP-NAME` with the app-specific details from the [**Facebook for Developers platform**](https://developers.facebook.com/).

</div>

- After adding the dependency, register the `RudderFacebookFactory` with your `RudderClient` initialization as a `factory` of `RudderConfig`. To do this, run the following command to import the `RudderFacebookFactory.h` file in your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```objectivec
#import <Rudder-Facebook/RudderFacebookFactory.h>
```

- Then, add the RudderStack iOS SDK initialization as shown:

```objectivec
RSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];
[builder withFactory:[RudderFacebookFactory instance]];
[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Android" %}
To add Facebook App Events to your Android project, follow these steps:

- Add the repository, as shown:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

- Add the following lines to your `app/build.gradle` file under the `dependencies` section, as shown:

```groovy
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:facebook:1.0.0'
implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:11.1.0'
```

- Open your `/app/res/values/strings.xml` file and add the following lines. **Remember to replace `[APP_ID]` with your actual app ID**.

```markup
<string name="facebook_app_id">[APP_ID]</string>
<string name="fb_login_protocol_scheme">fb[APP_ID]</string>
```

- In the `app/manifests/AndroidManifest.xml` file, add a `meta-data` element to the `application` element as shown:

```markup
<application android:label="@string/app_name" ...>
    ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
    ...
</application>
```

- Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` in your `Application` class, as shown:

```java
val rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
    this,
    WRITE_KEY,
    RudderConfig.Builder()
        .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
        .withFactory(FacebookIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)
        .build()
)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Identify

The `identify` call from RudderStack sets the `userId` through the `setUserID` method from `AppEventsLogger` .

RudderStack sets the following properties \(if available\) using the `setUserData` method.

- `email`
- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `phone`
- `birthday`
- `gender`
- `city`
- `state`
- `zip`
- `country`

A sample `identify` call for an iOS application looks like the following:

```text
[[RSClient sharedInstance] identify:@"developer_user_id"
                                 traits:@{@"email": @"bar@foo.com"}];
```

## Track

The `track` call from RudderStack is logged to Facebook using the `logEvent` method of the `AppEventsLogger` class. RudderStack uses the same `eventName` as you have passed to the `track` method. Along with that, it will pass all the `properties` after converting them into an accepted format.

A sample `track` call for an iOS application is as shown:.

```text
[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@"Accepted Terms of Service"
                      properties:@{
                          @"foo": @"bar",
                          @"foo_int": @134
                      }];
```

<div class="infoBlock">
When `revenue` and `currency` are present in the event properties of any `track` call, RudderStack makes a `Purchase` call to Facebook using its `logPurchase` API along with the normal `track` call using the `logEvent` API.

If `currency` is absent in the event properties RudderStack sets the default value to `USD`.

</div>

## Screen

The `screen` method lets you record whenever the user views their mobile screen along with any associated properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but is exclusive to your mobile device.

A sample `screen` call using the RudderStack Android SDK is as shown:

```text
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Home" properties:@{
    @"category" : @"launcher"
}];
```

In the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the viewed screen, such as screen name and `category`.

<div class="infoBlock">
The above `screen` call is directly passed on to Facebook as a `track` event via its `logEvent` API, with the event name as `Viewed {screen name} screen` along with the the associated properties. The above example will be sent as a `track` event with name `Viewed Home screen` along with its properties.

</div>

## Limited Data Use

In July 2020, Facebook released a [**Limited Data Use**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/data-processing-options) feature to give businesses better control over how their data is used in their **California Consumer Privacy Act \(CCPA\)** compliance efforts.

You can now send the **Limited Data Use** data processing parameters to Facebook for each event via RudderStack, so that Facebook can appropriately apply the userâ€™s data choice.

To use this feature, simply enable the **Limited Data Use** setting on the RudderStack dashboard and control its behavior via the following data processing parameters:

| **Parameter**                       | **Default Value** | **Description**                                                 |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Processing Options State**   | **`0`**           | Use Facebookâ€™s geolocation to determine the end-user's state.   |
| **Data Processing Options Country** | **`0`**           | Use Facebookâ€™s geolocation to determine the end-user's country. |

<div class="successBlock">

## Configuring Facebook App Events SDK Based on User Consent

This section highlights the different consent-based options for configuring the App Events SDK.

### Disable Automatically Logged Events

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}

- To disable automatic event logging, open the application's `.plist` as code in Xcode and add the following XML to the property dictionary:

```markup
<key>FacebookAutoLogAppEventsEnabled</key>
<false/>
```

- In some cases, you can delay the collection of automatically logged events to obtain user consent or fulfill legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the `setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled` method of the `FBSDKSettings` class to re-enable auto-logging after the end-user provides the required consent.

  - In **Objective-C**:

    ```objectivec
    [FBSDKSettings setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled:YES];
    ```

  - In **Swift**:

    ```swift
    FBSDKSettings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(true)
    ```

- To suspend event collection for any reason, set the `setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled` method to `NO` for iOS or `false` for Swift, as shown:

  - In **Objective-C**:

    ```objectivec
    [FBSDKSettings setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled:NO];
    ```

  - In **Swift**:

        ```swift
        FBSDKSettings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)
        ```

    {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Android" %}

- To disable automatically logged events, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```markup
<application>
  ...
  <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.AutoLogAppEventsEnabled"
           android:value="false"/>
  ...
</application>
```

- In some cases, you can delay the collection of automatically logged events to obtain user consent or fulfill legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the `setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled()` method of the `FacebookSDK` class and set it to `true` . This re-enables event logging after the end-user has provided the required consent.

```java
setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(true);
```

- To suspend event logging again for any reason, set the `setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled()` method to `false`, as shown:

```java
setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false);
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Disable Collection of Advertiser IDs

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}

- To disable the collection of advertiser ID, open the application's `.plist` as code in Xcode and add the following XML to the property dictionary:

```markup
<key>FacebookAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled</key>
<false/>
```

- In some cases, you can delay the collection of `advertiser_id` to obtain the user consent or fulfill any legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the `setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled` method of the `FBSDKSettings` class and set it to `YES` for iOS, or `true` for Swift after the end-user provides consent, as shown:

  - In **Objective-C**:

    ```objectivec
    [FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled:@YES];
    ```

  - In **Swift**:

    ```swift
    FBSDKSettings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(true);
    ```

- To suspend collection for any reason, set the `setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled` method to `NO` for iOS or `false` for Swift.

  - In **Objective-C**:

    ```objectivec
    [FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled:@NO];
    ```

  - In **Swift**:

        ```swift
        FBSDKSettings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
        ```

    {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Android" %}

- To disable collection of `advertiser-id`, add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```markup
<application>
  ...
  <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.AdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled"
           android:value="false"/>
  ...
</application>
```

- In some cases, you can delay the collection of `advertiser_id` to obtain user consent or fulfill any legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the `setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled()` method of the `FacebookSDK` class and set it to `true` . This re-enables the collection of `advertiser_id` after the end-user provides the required consent, as shown:

```java
setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(true);
```

- To suspend collection for any reason, set the `setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled()` method to `false`, as shown:

```java
setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Disable Automatic SDK Initialization

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
To disable automatic SDK initialization in case of the Android SDK, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```markup
<application>
  ...
  <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.AutoInitEnabled"
           android:value="false"/>
  ...
</application>
```

In some cases, you can delay the SDK initialization to obtain user consent or fulfill any legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the class method `setAutoInitEnabled` and set it to `true` to manually initialize the SDK after the end-user provides the required consent.

```java
FacebookSdk.setAutoInitEnabled(true)
FacebookSdk.fullyInitialize()
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
