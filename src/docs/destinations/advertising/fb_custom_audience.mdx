# Facebook Custom Audience

[**Facebook Custom Audience**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences) is a popular targeting tool that lets you find people on Facebook interested in your business. It lets you create custom audiences through customer lists, Facebook engagement, and website/app traffic.

RudderStack lets you send your customer events for creating custom audiences by leveraging the Facebook Marketing API.

You can now send your customer events data list directly for adding them to already created Facebook Custom Audience through RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">
The user information in your events may include email, phone number, gender, etc. For more information on the supported fields, refer the documentation [**here**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences#hash).

</div>

<div class="successBlock">
  **Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our**
  [**GitHub
  repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/fb_custom_audience)**.**
</div>

## Getting Started

To enable sending your event data to Facebook Custom Audience, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack.Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Custom Audience.

Before configuring Facebook Custom Audience as a destination, verify if the source platform supports sending events to Custom Audience by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------ | :--------- | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -       | -          | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | -       | -          | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/rudderstack-connection-modes) guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Custom Audience, perform the steps below:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. Then, select **Facebook Custom Audience** from the list of destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">
Please follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/how-to-guides/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack) to add a source and destination in RudderStack.

</div>

- Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You will then see the following screen:

## Custom Audience Connection Settings

To add Custom Audience as a destination in RudderStack, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Access Token** Enter the access token of your business application set up for accessing the Facebook Marketing API.

<div class="infoBlock">
Check the **FAQ** section for more information on how to find your User Access Token.

</div>

- **Schema Fields** Choose your schema fields \(at least one\) from the available options. **This is a mandatory field**. RudderStack expects the user events to consist of **every** schema field that has been chosen on the dashboard, in the same order.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack will ignore any user information which does not adhere to the specified schema fields in the dashboard settings.

</div>

- **Map Specific Events To Audience ID**: Enter the **Event Name\(s\)** you are going to use to send your user data to Rudderstack \(for e.g.`uploadingCustomAudience`,`trimmingCustomAudience` etc.\). Also, specify the corresponding **Custom Audience ID\(s\)** to which the audiences will be added to/removed from.

<div class="infoBlock">
Check the **FAQ** section for more information on how to find your Audience ID.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
You can only send `track` events with the event names specified in the dashboard.

</div>

- Some other important settings are:
  - **Enable Hashing**: Facebook expects the user data to be hash encoded using `SHA256`. if this option is enabled, RudderStack will hash encode the user data irrespective of the schema type chosen in the RudderStack dashboard.
  - **Disable Formatting**: Facebook has fixed data formats for all the allowed schema fields. If this option is enabled, RudderStack will not format the user data before sending it to Custom Audience.

## The `track` Event Structure to Send User Data to Custom Audience

<div class="warningBlock">
**The Facebook Custom Audience destination supports only `track` calls.**

</div>

The `userListAdd` and `userListDelete` arrays containing the user data objects are expected inside the properties field of the `track` event.

- **userListAdd**: Refers to the user information that needs to be added to the custom audience.
- **userListDelete**: Refers to the user information that needs to be deleted from the custom audience.

A detailed description of the session fields as prescribed in the [**Facebook documentation**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/custom-audience/users/#parameters) is documented in the following table:

| **Rudderstack-supported Field Name**      | **Marketing API Field Name** | **Data Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessionIdAdd`                            | `session_id`                 | `int64`       | This is the advertiser-generated identifier which is used to add users to a custom audience while tracking the session. It should be unique for each ad account.      |
| `sessionIdDelete`                         | `session_id`                 | `int64`       | This is the advertiser-generated identifier which is used to remove users from a custom audience while tracking the session. It should be unique for each ad account. |
| `batch_seq`,`batchSeq`,`batchSequence`    | `batch_seq`                  | `int64`       | This refers to the sequence number used to identify the request in the session.                                                                                       |
| `last_batch_flag`,`lastBatchFlag`         | `last_batch_flag`            | `boolean`     | This is set to `true` when sending the last request.                                                                                                                  |
| `estimated_num_total`,`estimatedNumTotal` | `estimated_num_total`        | `int64`       | Refers to the estimated total number of users to be uploaded in a particular session.                                                                                 |

<div class="warningBlock">
You cannot add or remove users from a custom audience using the same value for `sessionIdAdd` and `sessionIdDelete`.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
For adding the session information to any user addition/deletion operation, the Facebook Marketing API expects the `session_id`, `batch_seq`, `last_batch_flag` fields to be present. **However, note that the data addition and deletion operations are possible without explicitly specifying the session information.**

</div>

## Schema Fields Mapping

The following table details the mapping of the schema fields specified in the [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/) and the Facebook Marketing API.

## Explicit Formatting Feature

If the **Disable Formatting** option is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard, RudderStack will not format the user data in the format prescribed by the Facebook Marketing API. If it is disabled, RudderStack formats the schema fields input by the user as shown in the table below:

| **Schema Field Name** | **Example Input** | **Formatted Output \(Before Hashing\)** |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `EMAIL`               | `ABC@gmail.com`   | `abc@gmail.com`                         |
| `PHONE`               | `0@96346895`      | `96346895`                              |
| `GEN`                 | `FEMALE`          | `f`                                     |
| `DOBD`                | `2`               | `02`                                    |
| `DOBM`                | `1`               | `01`                                    |
| `LN & FN`             | `Abc,@`           | `abc@`                                  |
| `FI`                  | `Mr.`             | `mr.`                                   |
| `CT`                  | `HN#`             | `hn`                                    |
| `ST`                  | `? AL ?`          | `al`                                    |

The following code snippet shows a `track` event with the schema fields \(e.g.`EMAIL`,`FIRST NAME`\) specified in the RudderStack dashboard:

```python
import rudder_analytics

rudder_analytics.write_key = WRITE_KEY
rudder_analytics.data_plane_url = DATA_PLANE_URL

rudder_analytics.track('USER-ID', 'EVENT-NAME', {

 'sessionIdAdd': 123,
 'sessionIdDelete':456,
 'batchSequence': 10,
 'lastBatchFlag': true,

 'userListAdd': [
       {
         'EMAIL': 'name1@abc.com',
         'FN': 'name1'
       },
       {
         'EMAIL': 'name2@abc.com',
         'FN': 'name2'
       }
     ],
     'userListDelete': [
       {
         'Email': 'name3@abc.com',
         'FN': 'name3'
       },
       {
         'Email': 'name4@abc.com',
         'FN': 'name4'
       }

<div class="infoBlock">
`sessionIdAdd` and `sessionIdDelete` helps you track and use a particular session ID while adding or removing users. This is useful when you are sending data in chunks. If you do not include these fields, Facebook creates a session ID itself.

Refer to the [**Facebook documentation**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences#step-2--specify-a-list-of-users) for more information on this.

The following code snippet shows a `track` event having only `userListAdd` with the schema fields \(e.g.`EMAIL`,`FIRST NAME`\) specified in the RudderStack dashboard:

```python
rudder_analytics.track('USER-ID', 'EVENT-NAME', {
  sessionIdDelete: 456,
  batchSequence: 10,
  lastBatchFlag: true,

  userListAdd: [
    {
      EMAIL: 'name1@abc.com',
      FN: 'name1',
    },
    {
      EMAIL: 'name2@abc.com',
      FN: 'name2',
    },
  ],
})
```

As the `sessionIdAdd` field is absent, the above example does not create a session explicitly but successfully adds users to Facebook Custom Audience.

<div class="infoBlock">
Similarly, you can use `userListDelete` in order to remove users from a particular custom audience without creating a session.

</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
The event payload must include `userListAdd` or `userListDelete` . Otherwise, the user data won’t be transformed and sent to Custom Audience.

### Should I use `sessionIdAdd` or `sessionIdDelete` before adding/removing users in Custom Audience?

`sessionIdAdd` and `sessionIdDelete` helps you track and use a particular session ID while adding or removing users. This is useful when you are sending data in chunks. If you do not include these fields, Facebook creates a session ID itself.

Refer to the [**Facebook documentation**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences#step-2--specify-a-list-of-users) for more information on this.
