# Delighted

[**Delighted**](https://delighted.com/) is a popular customer feedback platform. It allows your teams to gather instant, invaluable, and actionable customer feedback to improve your processes and product.

RudderStack supports Delighted as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our**
[**GitHub
repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/delighted)**.**
{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Delighted by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud** **mode**  | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

{% hint style="info" %}
To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/rudderstack-connection-modes) guide.

{% endhint %}

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Delighted, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Delighted**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/how-to-guides/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack) for more information.

{% endhint %}

- Give a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

![Delighted Connection Settings](../../.gitbook/assets/Delighted.png)

- Enter your Delighted **API Key**.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on how to get your Delighted API key, refer to the Delighted [**docs**](https://app.delighted.com/docs/api).

{% endhint %}

- By default, the channel is set to **Email**. You can also select **SMS** from the dropdown.
- Set the **Delay** value \(in seconds\) here. By default it is set to **0**.
- To make a `track` call, enter the **Event Names** for which `track` call will be triggered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the RudderStack dashboard does not contain the **Event** for which the `track` call is triggered, RudderStack will throw an error.

{% endhint %}

- Finally, click on **Next**. Delighted will now be enabled as a destination in Rudderstack.

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you to add a user to your **People** [**List**](https://app.delighted.com/people). If the user already exists, RudderStack will update the user with the latest information. This includes `userId` as well as other additional properties related to user like name,phone number/email, channel, and the 'Last sent at' timestamp.

- The `userId` provided during the call must match the **Channel** type. The channel type can be either set from Rudderstack dashboard or you can send it via the `identify` call with the parameter `DelightedChannelType`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The channel type set via the `identify` call will get a higher precedence.

{% endhint %}

- You can provide the user email or phone number. Both are not required at the same time, since one of the values will be set from the `userId`.
- You can also send the `last_sent_at` value with the call. Refer to the example below for more details.

{% hint style="info" %}
`Last sent at` \(in UNIX timestamp\) is used to manually set the time a person was most recently sent a survey. This value will be used in the Delighted **Survey throttling** system, which ensures that same person wonâ€™t be surveyed more than once per month.

To change its value manually, go the Delighted [**dashboard**](https://app.delighted.com/dashboard), select your **Project** from top left corner and click on the settings icon beside **Project Name**.

{% endhint %}

A sample `identify` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("name@surname.com", {
  name: "User",
  last_sent_at: "1624293839",
  phone_number: "+1234567890"},
  { externalId: [
    {
        type: "delightedChannelType",
        id: "sms"
    }
  ]}
});
```

In this example, since the `userId` is already an email, you can provide the user's `phone_number` as well. Also, the `delightedChannelType` will override the **Channel Type** set in the RudderStack dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
Except `userId`, all the other fields in the call are optional.

{% endhint %}

## Track

The `track` call lets you send the survey to the user added to the **People** [**List**](https://app.delighted.com/people) in your account. In addition to name, phone number/email,channel, and the 'Last sent at' timestamp, you can also add as many custom properties as you need.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the user does not exist, you cannot make a `track` call. You need to first add the user in the People list via the `identify` call.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Delay** value from the dashboard will override the value sent via the `track` call.

{% endhint %}

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Test", {
  delighted_email_subject: "Custom Email Subject.",
  customProperty: "Custom Value",
  customProperty2: "Custom Value2"},
  { externalId: [
    {
        type: "delightedChannelType",
        id: "sms"
    }
  ]}
});
```

In the above example, `Test` is the event name. Except the event name, all other fields are optional.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not enter the **Event** name in the dashboard for which the `track` call is triggered, RudderStack will throw an error.

{% endhint %}

Delighted also provides some custom properties by itself. In the above example, `delighted_email_subject` sets the email subject of the survey to `Custom Email Subject`. Note that this change can be done from the [**Delighted website**](https://app.delighted.com/platforms) too.

Some other default properties provided by Delighted are mentioned in the table below:

| **Delighted Property**    | **Description**                                                                            |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question_product_name`   | Delighted shows this question in the survey.                                               |
| `delighted_intro_message` | Delighted displays this message in the email subject.                                      |
| `locale`                  | This property determines the localization \(including language\) of the survey experience. |

For more default properties, check out this Delighted [**support page**](https://help.delighted.com/article/577-special-properties).

In the example shown above, `customProperty` is the custom property field that you can set. Note that you must provide values for these custom fields, or else they will be dropped by Delighted.

## Alias

The `alias` call allows you to update the user's email or phone number. You need to set `previousId` as the current value and `userId` as the updated value.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `previousId` and `userId` must be of the same type, i.e., either email or phone number.

{% endhint %}

A sample `alias` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("new@email.com", "old@email.com")
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Both `previousId` and `userId` are required.

{% endhint %}
