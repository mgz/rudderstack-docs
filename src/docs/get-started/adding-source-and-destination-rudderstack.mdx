# How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack

RudderStack allows you to send your event data from either your website or a mobile device \(Android and iOS\) to a destination platform of your choice. A destination is a platform that uses your event data for analytics. However, in order to so, it is important to correctly add and configure your source and destination on the RudderStack platform.

## Adding a source

To add a source, please follow these steps:

- Log in to the [RudderStack app](https://app.rudderlabs.com/login). Once logged in, your home page should look like the following:

<span class="imageTitle">RudderStack Dashboard</span>

- Click on **ADD SOURCE.**
- Choose the source from which you want to collect the event data. We support JavaScript \(web app\), as well as Android and iOS.

- Once you choose the source, please type the name you want to assign to that source.

<span class="imageTitle">The Name your source screen</span>

- Once you have added the source, you should see the following screen, with an option to add a destination. That's it, you are good to go!

<div class="infoBlock">
You can note the <strong>write key</strong> and use it to configure the SDK, in order to send the event data from it.

## Adding a destination

Please follow the steps below to add a destination to which you want to send your event data:

<div class="infoBlock">
Make sure you have added a source before you add a destination.

- Click on the **ADD DESTINATION** option as shown:

- Name your destination. In case you are adding multiple destinations for various sources, ensure that the destination names are unique.

<span class="imageTitle">Naming your destination</span>

- The source you have configured initially will automatically appear at this stage. Click on **Next**.
- You will now be required to enter **Tracking ID** associated with the destination. Ideally, you should be able to retrieve this from the admin dashboard of that destination. In case of Google Analytics, as an example, you can retrieve it as shown below:

<img src="../../images/assets/dest5 (1).png" />
<span class="imageTitle">Google Analytics dashboard for retrieving Tracking ID</span>

- Once you have retrieved Tracking ID, enter it in the **RudderStack Connection Settings** page as shown:

<img src="../../images/assets/dest6 (1).png" />
<span class="imageTitle">RudderStack Connection Settings</span>

- If you want to transform your source event data, you can select the **Create New Transformation** option. Otherwise, select the **No transformation needed** option to send the event data as is, to the destination. Then, click **Next**.

And that's it! You have successfully added a destination and configured it to receive the event data from your source! Your dashboard should now look like the following:
