# Native Installation

<div class="warningBlock">
This is <strong>not</strong> the easiest way of installing RudderStack. Use this method only if you want to know more about the RudderStack internals.

</div>

## Prerequisites

To set up a native installation of RudderStack, you will need to set up and install the following tools in your development environment:

- [**Go 1.13**](https://golang.org/dl/) or above.
- [**Node.js 10.6**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or above.
- [**PostgreSQL 10**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or above

## Installation

- First, set up the database in your preferred directory using the following commands:

```bash
createdb jobsdb
createuser --superuser rudder
psql "jobsdb" -c "alter user rudder with encrypted password 'rudder'";
psql "jobsdb" -c "grant all privileges on database jobsdb to rudder";
```

- Sign up and log into the [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup). Copy your workspace **Token** from the top of the page, as shown:

<strong>Why do I need to sign up on RudderStack?</strong>

RudderStack's dashboard (<a href="../../get-started/rudderstack-architecture#control-plane">Control Plane</a> lets you set up your data pipelines by configuring event data sources and destinations. This dashboard is hosted by RudderStack and is free for open-source users.

If you don't wish to sign up for RudderStack, you can also set up your own control plane using the open-source <a href="../../user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-config-generator">RudderStack Config Generator</a>. However, note that the control plane set up using the RudderStack Config Generator lacks certain features like <a href="../../adding-a-new-user-transformation-in-rudderstack">Transformations</a> and <a href="../../user-guides/how-to-guides/live-destination-event-debugger">Live Events Debugger</a>.

</div>

- Create a directory for the RudderStack server using the following command:

```bash
mkdir rudder-server
```

- Go to the RudderStack GitHub repository, [**download**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/releases) the latest binary for your target system, and move it to the `rudder-server` directory.
- Create a directory for the RudderStack transformer using the following command:

```bash
mkdir rudder-transformer
```

- Go to the RudderStack Transformer page in the GitHub repo and \***\*[**download**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/releases) \*\***the latest release package. Then, extract it in the `rudder-transformer` directory.
- Navigate to the transformer directory using the following command:

```bash
cd rudder-transformer
```

- Then, install the dependencies using the command `npm i` .
- Next, start the destination transformer using the following command:

```bash
node destTransformer.js
```

- Navigate back to the main directory using the command `cd rudder-server`.
- Then, create a `.env` file, and copy the contents of the [`sample.env`](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/blob/master/config/sample.env) file into this `.env` file.
- Update the`WORKSPACE_TOKEN` environment variable in this `.env` file with the token that you copied from your RudderStack dashboard.
- Finally, run the RudderStack server using the following command:

```bash
./rudder-server
```

Once you have completed these steps above successfully, [**send test events**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack#sending-test-events-to-verify-the-installation) to verify the installation.
