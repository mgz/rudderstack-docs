# Connections

RudderStack lets you set up connections between your preferred event data sources and destinations. With this feature, you can build efficient data pipelines across your entire customer data stack.

{% hint style="success" %}
**With RudderStack, you can bring together all your event data across your web, mobile, server-side, and cloud apps and route this data reliably to your data warehouse and other third-party platforms of your choice.**
{% endhint %}

## Sources

A **source** refers to a platform or an application \(web, mobile, server-side, or a third-party cloud app\) from where RudderStack tracks and collects your event data.

{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend creating a source for every unique source of data. You can also create multiple sources for each website or application from which you want to track the data.
{% endhint %}

To view all the configured sources in your RudderStack dashboard, click on **Sources** in the left navigation bar, as shown:

![](../.gitbook/assets/3%20%2820%29.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
You can add a new source by simply clicking on the **Add Source** button. For more details on adding a source in RudderStack, refer to the guide on [**Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack.md).
{% endhint %}

### Source Details

To get more details on the configured source, click on it. You should then see the following view on the dashboard:

![](../.gitbook/assets/4%20%2820%29.png)

The options you see in this page are as follows:

- **Source ID**: The unique identifier associated with your source.
- **Write Key**: The write key is required to send the data from your source.

{% hint style="success" %}
As an example, you can load [**RudderStack's JavaScript SDK**](../stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) on your web pages to track and collect the events by running the following:

`rudderanalytics.load(<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, options);`
{% endhint %}

- **Add Destination**: You can connect your source to a new destination by clicking on this button.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, you should click on the **Connect Destination** button.
{% endhint %}

- **Live Events**: Once your source and destination are successfully configured and a connection is set up and enabled, RudderStack starts tracking and collecting events from your source. These events can be viewed in real-time using this option.

### Deleting a Source

You can delete a source by clicking on the **Delete Source** button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before you delete a source, make sure there are no active destinations enabled for it.
{% endhint %}

## Destinations

A destination is a tool or application where you want to send the data via RudderStack.

{% hint style="success" %}
RudderStack currently supports over 80 destinations. These include [**data warehouses**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/data-warehouse-integrations), [**analytics**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/analytics) platforms, [**CRMs**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/crm), [**marketing**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/marketing) platforms, and more.
